*Diff bw angular 1 and ng2
    -> ng2 is component based and i have used typeScript to create angular2 applications
    -> ng2 has removed 2 ways data binding, it has only uni directional data binding.
    -> ng2 is more modular then ng1, it has js module and angular module
    -> ng2 has ahead-of-time compilation (AOT) ----------- it loads templates at the very beginning before even data comes from backend
    -> they made ng2 mobiler keeping in mind , mobile loads angular site more faster
    -> ng2 has its own CLI , no need to install yeoman

1. 4 things in angular2

    component   :
    service     :
    directive   :
    router     :


2. App.component.ts is the first file that has module which is going to be load in index.html.
For every component will be written into a new component file.
We must need to export the class if we want to use it somewhere else.


    file :      story.component.ts

        export class StoryComponent {
        nane : string
        name = "Viraj";
        }

        @Component ()
        // COMPONENT : This is a decorator
